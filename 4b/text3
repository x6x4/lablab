The DOT language assumes at least the ASCII character set. 
Quoted strings, both ordinary and HTML-like, may contain non-ASCII characters. 
In most cases, these strings are uninterpreted: they simply serve as unique identifiers or 
values passed through untouched. Labels, however, 
are meant to be displayed, which requires that the software be able to compute the size of 
the text and determine the appropriate glyphs. For this, it needs to know what character encoding is used.
